# Shopping Distance
## Overview
The Shopping Distance App provides businesses across all industries the opportunity to manage customer traffic within stores to ensure COVID-19 regulations are met. Through business’ web portal, customers can schedule shopping timeslots in advance while ensuring store capacity remains within standards. When a customer arrives, frontline personnel can efficiently manage reservation and walk-in customer traffic track party size and potential COVID-19 exposure.
